# RasTouch
Server component for the [HomeNotifier](https://github.com/HappeyHunter/HomeNotifierQt)

Use the menu options to select the message category, then the actual message, and finally the target for the message.

Up to two targets can be configured by creating a 'TargetNames' file 
, where each line is a target, and placing it in the same directory as 
the executable.

Right clicking on the category selection menu will close the application.
